# golang-json-experiment

This project tests various mechanisms for parsing JSON in Go. Commentary on each will be available in an upcoming blog post.

To run:

	$ godep restore
	$ go build
	$ ./golang-json-experiment

## Classes of mechanisms

- `strict_struct.go` - Parsing JSON into predefined structures. This includes structure definitions generated by: [gojson](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/gojson), [json-to-go](http://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/), [jflect](http://godoc.org/github.com/str1ngs/jflect), and [json-to-struct](https://github.com/tmc/json-to-struct)
- `loose_struct.go` - Dealing with JSON that is parsed into the empty interface.
- `wrapper.go` - Using empty interface wrapping packages to handle type conversion. This includes: [typed](https://github.com/karlseguin/typed), [go-simplejson](https://github.com/bitly/go-simplejson), and [jason](https://github.com/antonholmquist/jason)
- ***TODO*** `compiled.go` - Using tools to pre-compile JSON parsers for performance reasons.


## Sample data

Sample JSON used to test is included as raw JSON and [Paw](https://luckymarmot.com/paw) project. 

At this time, only one sample JSON set is included:

-  The Move API call from [Battlesnake](https://github.com/sendwithus/battlesnake)
